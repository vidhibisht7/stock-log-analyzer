# Stock Log File Analyzer

This is a C++ project that reads, filters, analyzes, and visualizes historical stock data using a CSV file (`all_stocks_5yr.csv`). It also includes a simple frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase the analysis.


## Features

- Read large stock datasets from CSV
- Analyze individual companies by stock name (like AAPL, GOOGL, etc.)
- Calculate key statistics like average open/close price, min/max, and trends
- Output results to `output.txt`
- Frontend displays the output file contents neatly
